This sequence of exercises provides a basic overview of the type of research that my group does. The ability to complete these exercises without assistance forms what I would consider the 'minimum bar' of the technical background that I expect of my students. Since these exercises involve a non-trivial amount of work, I want to clearly and accurately characterize 'the chances' that I'd accept you as a student. Many dozens of students express interest in joining my research group each year, of which I am only able to accept a couple. Successful completion of these exercises does not mean that I will accept you; it simply means that you've passed the first step of many. It will be a positive factor in my consideration of your application. My hope is that, regardless, you will have learned something in completing these exercises. If you'd like to start this journey, get started on the assignment. Drop me an email once you have completed the onboarding - by 'completed' I mean that your pull request has been merged into the main trunk of both the Anserini and Pyserini repos. In your email, send me links to your commit on GitHub so I can associate you with your GitHub user id.",

This sequence of exercises provides a basic overview of the type of research that my group does. The ability to complete these exercises without assistance forms what I would consider the 'minimum bar' of the technical background that I expect of my students.

Successful completion of these exercises does not mean that I will accept you; it simply means that you've passed the first step of many. It will be a positive factor in my consideration of your application. My hope is that, regardless, you will have learned something in completing these exercises.
