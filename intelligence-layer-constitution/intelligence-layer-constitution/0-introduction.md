# CanApply Intelligence Layer Constitution (v0.1)

## 0. Purpose

The CanApply Intelligence Layer (“the Layer”) is a **workflow-centric decision and execution runtime** that converts user and system requests into **auditable outcomes** under **explicit policies**.

Chat is one interface. The Layer is an integration-ready engine intended to scale from:

* v1: funding outreach automation
* v2: admissions process automation
* v3: customer problem resolution
* v4: enterprise copilot inside academic systems

The Layer’s promise is: **reduce user cognitive load while increasing correctness, traceability, and operational leverage**.
